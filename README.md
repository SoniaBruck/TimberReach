# TimberReach
## Assessing merchantability on NFS lands

The USDA Forest Service (FS) conducts timber sales on National Forests (NFs) for
economic and environmental benefits, such as decreasing fire hazard through removal of
biomass, as well as increasing income to the agency. “No-bids,” or unsold timber offerings, can
cause planned management activities to be delayed, deferred, or require additional time and cost.

Not all acres suitable for timber management are merchantable. Merchantability is subject to factors such as: proximity to mill, road networks, species composition and form, among others. Through prior no-bids research (Bruck and Frey 2023; Frey et al. 2023; Frey at al. 2024; Bruck et al. 2025), we have identified crucial factors that result in timber sales. In addition, we
have found that there are several disparate data sources, many of which are maintained by the FS
Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW). Once aggregated, we will identify areas of the National Forest landscape that are more or less likely to sell, if advertised.
